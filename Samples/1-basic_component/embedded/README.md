# Basic "Embedded" Component Sample

This basic "Hello World" Scriptable Component (SC) contains rudimentary metadata for a reflowable EPUB parent with a Fixed
Layout SC and appropriate accessible metadata for keyboard control. This sample is purely a packaging example showing the use of the parent EPUB `<collection>` element denoting the child SC then manually positioned in the parent templated content document via the `<iframe>` "landing zone".
